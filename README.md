# VulnerabilityScanner

Most cybersecurity tools the average person uses are ad hoc, or after the attack already occurs, such as most antivirus software. However, there is barely any software that looks for vulnerabilities before an attack even occurs. 

Vulnerability Scanner will do exactly what it's called: scan your computer to find what vulnerabilities there are, and let you know where your system is insecure before an attack occurs. 

## Current State

Sort of working. Does print to console every vulnerability on the github, however it can definitely be tidied up

## How does it work?

The Vulnerability Scanner works by first checking what operating system and version your computer is running, and then checking the online database of exploit db to find what vulnerabilities exist for this version of the operating system. The user will then be given a list of all of the vulnerabilities that exist for that version of your operating system. 

## Future Goals

Future goals could include checking to see if the vulnerability has been fixed, checking other software on a user's computer for weaknesses there, or even testing the vulnerabilities to see if they work on your machine. 

Check to see if these vulnerabilites are applicable to your computer?

## Requirements

Needs Jsoup to run
